The app was great at getting me checked in/boarded, keeping me updated on my flight status and luggage status*, as well as keeping me informed on gate changes (which gave me so much peace of mind for someone who has never flown solo before and hasn’t had much experience with airports)\\n\\n*The one suggestion I do have for the app would be to only send notifications about baggage claim to those people who actually need to pick up their bags. Going to California this didn’t happen to me but coming back, I had a moment of sheer terror because I got a notification saying that I needed to pick up my bag for my connecting flight which would have made me late for the next one. After asking the person at the gate if this was true they looked at my baggage claim tag and told me that my luggage would be transferred and that sometimes everybody on a particular flight get that notification even if it doesn’t apply to them. Eventually, the app updated my bag status to being loaded on the plane as I was boarding but I definitely panicked for a good 10-15 minutes. Other than that one thing, I had nothing but a positive experience using the app',\n",

We were not able to check into our flight or make any changes using the app the night before. Our transportation got us to the airport as scheduled around 12:15. This would leave plenty of time to get settled and arrive to our gate. When we arrived at the airport we still could not check in at the kiosk there were 2 lines one for VeriFLY and one If you did not. I explained that I had VeriFLY but it was loading and my husband also had it and I was his companion. We were sent into the main assistance line and we did not reach the counter until 1:45 boarding started at 1:53. The rest of our party was at the gate and relaxed. We were so tired that we even asked if there was a voucher or option to stay and change our flight to the next day. After all of that standing in line They didn’t even ask for the paper of the negative covid test. We were  extremely frustrated and disappointed in this process. Other airlines had the option to quickly scan the covid results and keep things moving. We arrived at our gate just before boarding was closing and thankfully friends were able to grab us something to eat. Our luggage did arrive however the wheel was broken off of my suitcase.

Yet when we arrive to board they say we don’t have assigned seats (even though the app and our paper tickets had seats). Traveling with an 8year girl and autistic son, being split was not an option. After much frustration, the agent finally gave us two and two seats. Not how we wanted but fine, we at least got the flight to Orlando. Of course, being Orlando, we arrive and it’s raining!

When flying on American, you get a sense of complete and total apathy from check in through the completion of your flight. One reason for this is the criminally negligent management of the airline. It is managed by attorneys and accountants. AA management knows it can run a sub par operation because many times you don’t have a choice when you need to fly. They have a monopoly over many markets. In addition to this, they can shave off all the profits, enrich the upper management, and if they get into financial trouble the government is more than willing to bail them out with billions of YOUR tax dollars. Why should they care? There is zero incentive to operate in a manner which provides a top notch passenger experience. This goes for all of the airlines. This is now the pathetic status of our American transportation system. Take one ride on Emirates or Etihad and going back on an AA flight is like hitching a ride with a smelly hippy in the back of his 1976 Gremlin.',\n",

Example leave ICN at night to DFW and just before landing try and purchase a ticket for DFW to anywhere.

Several examples: I was on an AA flight operated by British Aerospace. The flight was delayed by two hours. The app showed it on time, and then showed the aircraft departed while we had not yet boarded. A similar issue happened again today. The app did not indicate that it could not retrieve information or TBD, but rather continues to display erroneous information. Other travel apps are receiving updated flight data so there is no excuse for the AA app to not work properly. If it is not capable of providing this information accurately, it’s not possible to trust it on other low priority information. BEWARE!',\n",

American Airlines is crap when it comes to customer service and a poor excuse globally when it comes to airlines. Literally third-world customer treatment and service. It is a disgrace and, I am embarrassed that “American” is in its brand. It is well beyond time for American Airlines to own up to its shoddy customer experiences, miserable operations, and overall crap excuse for an airline. It’s a shame. There’s a reason why American is also joked about as “Ghetto Air”.',\n",
