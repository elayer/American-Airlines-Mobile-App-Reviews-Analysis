0,marley_mae,"I downloaded this app for my most recent trip to California and I’m so glad I did (I don’t know how I would have survived without it)! The app was great at getting me checked in/boarded, keeping me updated on my flight status and luggage status*, as well as keeping me informed on gate changes (which gave me so much peace of mind for someone who has never flown solo before and hasn’t had much experience with airports)

*The one suggestion I do have for the app would be to only send notifications about baggage claim to those people who actually need to pick up their bags. Going to California this didn’t happen to me but coming back, I had a moment of sheer terror because I got a notification saying that I needed to pick up my bag for my connecting flight which would have made me late for the next one. After asking the person at the gate if this was true they looked at my baggage claim tag and told me that my luggage would be transferred and that sometimes everybody on a particular flight get that notification even if it doesn’t apply to them. Eventually, the app updated my bag status to being loaded on the plane as I was boarding but I definitely panicked for a good 10-15 minutes. Other than that one thing, I had nothing but a positive experience using the app",False,5,Very helpful!!,2021-08-28 19:20:58

Also... when I am in Premium Economy seats or pay for First... it is pathetic that you are not serving beverage service .... and can’t serve a snack or light meal as was our rationale for buying First in the past ... the service and the way we are treated in first.... so obvious that the management is using Covid as an excuse not to give the exceptional service that American has been known for.... other carriers are treating their loyal customers much better... makes you think about your

VeriFLY downloaded before the trip. Our trip went as planned and we had a wonderful time. We were not able to check into our flight or make any changes using the app the night before. Our transportation got us to the airport as scheduled around 12:15. This would leave plenty of time to get settled and arrive to our gate. When we arrived at the airport we still could not check in at the kiosk there were 2 lines one for VeriFLY and one If you did not. I explained that I had VeriFLY but it was loading and my husband also had it and I was his companion. We were sent into the main assistance line and we did not reach the counter until 1:45 boarding started at 1:53. The rest of our party was at the gate and relaxed. We were so tired that we even asked if there was a voucher or option to stay and change our flight to the next day. After all of that standing in line They didn’t even ask for the paper of the negative covid test. We were  extremely frustrated and disappointed in this process. Other airlines had the option to quickly scan the covid results and keep things moving. We arrived at our gate just before boarding was closing and thankfully friends were able to grab us something to eat. Our luggage did arrive however the wheel was broken off of my suitcase.

They lost my 18 months son’s stroller I went to their office and they said I can go to the store and get the new one , no matter if they find the one they lost and they will pay it for it. I came to Florida on vacation and I can not be in apartment and wait if the find the stroller or not. My kid spend half of the day in the stroller. So As they told me I went and bought the new one and mailed them the bill of the stroller and all other documents. I bought the same stroller we already had (the one they lost) . They never contacted me, It is been one month and half since ot happened, I am calling every day, they don’t pick up. I am sending emails they don’t answer. I spent $800 because of their fault but they don’t care. This is how they respect their passengers. By the way after 7 days they found the stroller they were lost, but I already bought the new one. I couldn’t wait for them and thinking Are they going to find it or not. Even they found it , the stroller were so dirty. The real color of stroller supposed to be white but they delivered to me very dirty , they were actually almost black. I was shocked.

The WiFi functionality in the air to stream just doesn’t work well in the app. How you have to switch back and forth multiple times going from ur WiFi settings to the app in order to play a video.  U should simply be on the WiFi and then be able to select entertainment and be able to select the video all in the app. The upgrade list isn’t well done and isn’t able to be seen in real time except right before boarding.  Interactive maps are terrible.  Push notifications for boarding, or modifying push notifications to 15 min before boarding so you can leave the Admirals club and make it to your gate on time.  

Also it is a pain when ur boarding pass expires when in the air, a big problem when ur flight is delayed.

I’m able to book revenue and award tickets, I’m able to select my seats, and when my upgrade processes I’m able to recheck my seat in the new cabin. I’m able to check-in and I find the app to be very useful in receiving flight updates.  My company uses concur, and the moment my flight is reserved in concur it shows up in the app. I’m able to understand if my flight may be impacted based on the app-provided “inbound” flight, and I’m able to live-track my baggage in the event that I check bags.

We flew from Phoenix to Orlando with a connecting flight from Charlotte. The night before I checked in with the app, cool! But then we get to Charlotte and it never gave me the option to check in so I figured I didn’t need to. The app was showing us the seats I specifically picked out when I bought the tickets. Yet when we arrive to board they say we don’t have assigned seats (even though the app and our paper tickets had seats). Traveling with an 8year girl and autistic son, being split was not an option. After much frustration, the agent finally gave us two and two seats. Not how we wanted but fine, we at least got the flight to Orlando. Of course, being Orlando, we arrive and it’s raining! With lightning! Our bags would not come due to the storm. Okay, we get it. But after two hours waiting AND all other airlines delivering their people their luggage, everyone starts to get mad. WTH?!?

Every time there was a complication, this app notified me and easily gave me an option to change my flight. I didn’t have to go through the hassle of going online and booking it from the website; everything was right on the app. I learned about flight cancellations, gate changes, and general updates on the app wayyyy before the airport gate boarders updated us in person.

I am Executive Platinum on American and the only reason I have that status is that I am forced to fly on American, there are just no other options many times. When flying on American, you get a sense of complete and total apathy from check in through the completion of your flight. One reason for this is the criminally negligent management of the airline. It is managed by attorneys and accountants. AA management knows it can run a sub par operation because many times you don’t have a choice when you need to fly. They have a monopoly over many markets. In addition to this, they can shave off all the profits, enrich the upper management, and if they get into financial trouble the government is more than willing to bail them out with billions of YOUR tax dollars. Why should they care? There is zero incentive to operate in a manner which provides a top notch passenger experience. This goes for all of the airlines. This is now the pathetic status of our American transportation system.

9,ViridianPhoton,"This app really made my travel experience easy not just in terms of getting flight and boarding info, but also navigating unfamiliar airports quickly.

I didn’t need to enter any info to have my reservation front and center, and it filtered out legs of my trip that I completed (though they’re still accessible)

The app has a map of each airports on the reservation, with their terminals/gates, and marks where the gate is in the map. You can also get directions if you want to.  I had very short layovers and needed to get quickly to my next gate, and this app made figuring out where and how I needed to get there effortless.

In addition it shows nearby airport restaurants and other things by name on the map.  Also, when browsing restaurants, it pre-filters them based on where you’re at. It even has their menus, which I appreciated b/c I eat GF and wanted to know ahead of time if it would be a waste of time to eat somewhere.  The map loaded fast too, and didn’t chug when I scrolled/zoomed.

The confirmation reminders helped me not forget to do it, and the boarding passes added to passbook in the proper order (small detail but other apps have messed this up or don’t add all boarding passes for a multi-leg trip).

They scam you by not allowing you to pick your seat unless you’re willing to pay for priority. They have done this to me on several flights where they insist that it’s a full flight so they cannot let you choose a flight and then when you get there it turns out they didn’t let half the flight pick their seats and assign them at random. The flight attendants refuse to help you and when you call customer service they say you have to talk to the flight attendants. 

Like I said they do this on multiple flights of mine to try and force you to pay for the priority seating, which isn’t even nicer btw. 

Additionally their planes are outdated without phone chargers or TVs. If you’re going to fly cheap you may as well go with Spirit which typically cost less and at least allow you to choose your seat.

So terrible it’s concerning! We had a flight that was delayed due to a hydraulic leak that the pilots missed during the pre check of the plane… the negligence of their piolits is concerning. Thankfully the baggage guys spotted it and reported the leak. Fast forward we missed our connection. Scheduled a new connection which we missed as well because they kept us in the plane as they attempted to have it repaired. Then we Stood in line to be told the only option was a flight the next day when someone else we had been talking to was given a different flight through United and Bahamas Air. We ended up having to book that same flight that was given to that other couple out of pocket as we already had our health visas and had scheduled events for our honeymoon the following day. We ended up spending our entire first day of our Honeymoon in the air port and on planes from 5:30 a.m until 10 p.m. 

The problems didn’t end their as our return connection flight was changed 3 times in 30 minutes. We ended up taking off an hour later than expected on plane that had a faulty AC system. Over all we had a terrible experience with American Airlines and I will never fly with them again.

It needs the ability to see ALL open seats on the flight you are on. It only shows the ones in your class.

Just a basic example: I was reading a book with the lights off, she turned on the lights for me and asked if I could see better. Wow!

Things missing:
1. Trip duration - want to know how long you’ll be in that metal tube so you can make better food/entertainment choices? Too bad! The app doesn’t tell you that.
2. Seat maps - want to know if that seat next to you is open or where the heck your seat actually is on the plane? Nope. You can’t.
3. Mileage accrual - want to know how many miles (EQMs) you’re earning for your current flight? Sorry!
4. Aircraft location - sometimes you can see information concerning your arrival aircraft. Most of the time you can’t. Unclear why this information can’t be available consistently.

While there is a lot to complain about concerning this app, the designers got a few things right:
1. Home screen provides useful information the day of flight
2. Track your bags is well integrated
3. Each flight instance being a “card” and swiping through them works well.",False,2,Solidly Sub-par,2019-02-23 00:16:47

Also, the gate agent did not provide us an explanation to the time changes and their costumer service rep failed to provide us with solutions/recommendations. Instead, he argued and said we should always check in with the gate agent, for any flight, which I don’t think is realistic for any customer.

Witness the shambles that IT is and has been, with absolutely no compunction about ignoring input from users. And users are customers who pay their salaries. 
American is also ignoring their most important stakeholders (paying customers) in the disastrous retrofit of the 737 fleet. It is particularly ironic that the model for the retrofit is the grounded 737 MAX. The flight worthiness of the MAX matches the unusable interiors. First class is now economy, economy is inhumane.

2962,Winston Salem Reader,"I don’t understand the low ratings.  This app is a must-have for frequent AA travelers.  I’ve flown 120+ segments on AA every year fo the past five years and I use the app for every flight.  The app is tremendously helpful to research flights, change seats, monitor the incoming flight and gate changes.  As a matter of fact, sometimes the app alerts me to gate changes before the gate agent is notified!  Keep up the good work!

Note to developers - the iOS 13.x upgrade seems to have broken the seat selection dialog box on a 12.9” iPad!  The window is too small and doesn’t properly show all seats.  Please fix.

Consider the following for app upgrades
1) I’d like to see how many first class seats remain.  If I’m #1 for first class upgrade but there are no seats, that would be helpful information and would eliminate a gate agent question.  Maybe you could add this to the upgrade list display?

2) I’d like to see the flight upgrade list sooner than an hour before the flight.  If I’m #5 on a plane with 4 first-class seats, earlier information would help me understand upgrade status sooner.

3) Consider adding a “Earlier Flight Options” button.  If business finishes sooner than expected, the only way to check for earlier flights is to use the “Book Flights” functionality.  I’d like to see a “Earlier Flight Option” button that is accessible directly from my current flight view.  And to be the most helpful, it should also allow easy viewing of available seats in the earlier flights!  (I’m not going to stand by for an earlier flight unless there are decent seats available..) 

4) It would be nice to have an app option that allows the user to control how early the boarding alert displays.  The app currently tells me when the flight is boarding...which isn’t helpful if I’m in the Admirals Club and have a bag to store.  I like to arrive at the gate 20-30 minutes before boarding before the crowds form.  If I could tell the app to remind me 20 minutes before boarding, I wouldn’t have to manually check the time.",False,5,Very Helpful App For Frequent Travelers,2019-10-19 12:48:27

3086,scarletblack1234,"My partner and I just arrived in Cali Colombia from Los Angeles USA. The experience we had with American Airlines the last 12 hours has been horrific to say the least. Upon paying a total of $1421 usd for our INTERNATIONAL flight, firstly we were disappointed to realise upon check in the checking in just one checked bag each would cost an extra $100 on top. Which is disgusting for an international flight at that price. Proceeding with our journey, on the first leg to Miami of a 5 hour flight time, we were beyond disbelief when we were told there was NO FOOD on the flight. Not serving a meal is one thing, but not being able to purchase any food either !?! We were offered a tiny bag of stale dry pretzels. My partner and I have medical conditions where we need to eat regularly to keep our sugar levels high, or we begin to get wheezy and faint. But we stuck out that leg of the flight. When we got off the flight, we had MINUTES to board the next flight to Cali, as there was barely any time allocated to get from one side of the airport to the other. We ran to the gate, and asked the gentleman prior to boarding if there would be food on this leg, he said YES. We were then waiting on the flight for 1.5 HOURS before take off as there was a problem with the plane, so this leg took a total of 4.5 hours. Once we were in the sky, we were told again there was NO FOOD except pretzels, and no food option to purchase. At this point we were about to faint and pass out. It felt like human torture. In between flights, not only did the man working for American Airlines at the gate tell us there would be food, but there was no time allocated in between the flights for us to even have time to be able to grab something prior to boarding.

3183,HawkeyeNMB,"I don’t often feel the need to wright reviews, and when I do they are always positive. However this third time this has happened has forced me to try and help others. After COUNTLESS delays (yes 10+) we were finally told we could board. And the app still told us the plane was delayed and not yet boarding.... Sat in the plane and heard multiple excuses from American staff as to the delay. First there was a plane issue, then no airline staff, then a mechanical delete, then we had to leave the plane after being warned we would lose our place if we left the plane. Everyone had to get off the plane after 5 hours and we we told our new gate and to watch the app for updates. We went to the bar meticulously watching the app for boarding times. Again delayed over and over and thank God I happened to get up and walk over to check the actual gate. They were boarding at their last call. I ran back and got my wife and sent her up to get on the plane, where the gate staff actually had the gall to yell at her to get on the plane and not wait for me. She was told she has to check the board AND NOT THE APP!!!. and the board behind this guy STILL SAID FLIGHT DELAYED!!!. Luckily I made it back up in time and got on the plane where we were delayed at least another hour again! I don’t know where they feel it’s ok to verbally abuse my wife who was following their app and their recommendations to the letter. If it was one mishap I can understand but this is the third time their app has given us false information that would have cost us our flight. And then the final kicker... we couldn’t get seats together unless we paid more at the airport. We were in the same row but in the middle on both sides of the aisle. Upon boarding the plane we were informed our seats had been switched and we would be sitting together after all. And that is because the family we were sitting next to in that same row actually paid extra to get them all together. American actually INTENTIONALLY spaced us out in the hopes one of our groups would pay extra to be seated together. This is UNETHICAL and ABUSIVE behavior to their customers. I would highly recommend that nobody EVER download or trust this app, we were intentionally misled in hopes we would miss our flight to accommodate their overbooking and profit maximizing schemes.

3187,Marisa Mast,"I booked a flight with American Airlines that was canceled (with no explanation I assumed it was due to weather). The flight was supposed to leave on a Saturday. After an hour of standing in line waiting to see what myself and two others were going to do the woman at the counter was not apologetic or sympathetic at all. In fact she was having a side conversation with a co-worker as I was speaking to her. American Airlines said the didn’t have a flight for us until MONDAY with no sleeping accommodations and could not even offer to pay for travel to a hotel. Another woman that works for American Airlines offered to go retrieve my checked bag. She came back empty handed and told me I had to walk to a baggage claim booth to retrieve it. I walked across the airport over to the booth and another woman was extremely rude and told me she didn’t understand why I was speaking to her. In fact, she said “take a look around if you don’t see your bag I obviously do not have it.” I walked back to the American Airlines counter and the woman I was originally dealing with told me she had to go to the bathroom and would make it a priority to help me upon her return. After 10 minutes she returns and starts doing something else that has nothing to do involving me. I approached her again and she apologized. She said she was going to go find my bag and come back. After a half hour of waiting I go looking for this woman only to find her talking to someone else in the hallway with no intentions of explaining where my luggage was. She frantically tells me American Airlines accidentally flew my bag to Charolette (my end destination was Cleveland) and to call American Airlines to locate my bag.

3198,cnnblahblahblah,"We spent 27 hours accosted in Saint Lucia after our flight was delayed. The airport staff was incredibly incompetent, don’t care and straight up lied to us at times. There’s dirty visqueen literally just stapled to the ceiling. The food is mediocre at best, very limited and incredibly expensive. The outside looks like it’s been to war. There’s no where to plug your phone. The WiFi is slower than a snail. They put passengers in hotels that had no running water and blood on the sheets. Then gave us $12 food vouchers that wouldn’t even purchase a full meal. We spent $34 on Chex mix and sodas. No smoking area and denied exit after 12 hours sitting around. They had a pregnant woman, young children and elderly people sitting around on plastic airport chairs for a full day. 

After 27 hours of being stuck there, and most of it sitting in a terrible airport, the crew comes prancing out for the final time after refusing to fly all this time due to “maintenance issues”. Mind you, everyone can see the plane the whole time and NO maintenance is occurring. No one went near the plane. They turned around and started walking away for about the fourth time when they were approached by several furious passengers. Then comes “Captain Sam” (who portrays the hero) and 10 minutes later we’re boarding the SAME PLANE that’s allegedly having maintenance issues! 

Once on the plane, I heard the first and ONLY apology from the flight crew. They profusely apologized over and over. Thanks. Apologies were meaningless. We want compensation for that. Horrible experience. We will not be returning to Saint Lucia because of the airport staff and American Airlines.

3357,Janielyne,"Another bad experience on American.  From when I arrived at the front counter til I boarded the plane the agent (both at front counter and at the gate) have obviously forgotten that the paying customer is why they have a job. A smile was not only a challenge but was nonexistent. I’m a retired AAL flight attendant, my husband is a captain for AAL and my daughter is a flight attendant and I’m embarrassed at what AAL has become since USAIR and AAL became one. I was full fare (as I always am while traveling in business every week) and was so disappointed in the lack of customer service. I have always been able to choose my airline when on business and it kills me that 90% of the time I choose Delta because they are doing it right. It’s amazing what a welcoming smile can do or a “thank you for choosing American, we appreciate your business” can do. Neither of those gestures cost the AAL brand a dime. I wish this was a “Covid” thing but it’s not. It’s been 7+ years that I have been choosing not to spend my company’s money on AAL because of lack of customer service. I started my career in 1984 with AAL, loved every minute of my 26 years. I wish I could understand why the brand thinks that because they are the largest they are the best. In this case, quantity does not reflect quality. 
Please, please, please, listen....this is an honest message from a person whose whole family is invested in American Airlines. Improvements are needed and would  not be costly. My heart breaks when I see what this company has become (prior Covid) the past several years. 
I’m the first to sing the praise of the deserving unfortunately I cannot, once again. 
I hope the new year brings change for American.

3369,jxnmom,"American is by far the worst airline ever.
Because of the miscommunication about the pet carrier this trip has cost me an extra 1000 and a job interview. 

You see, not only did I miss the job interview because I could not get back home in time but my flight was cancelled this evening. My 10y o daughter and I are stuck in Charlotte North Carolina- our flight home to Jackson was cancelled, there were no rental cars available and AA booked ONLY MY MINOR CHILD on a flight home tomorrow (actually today Sunday because it is 2am). My 10 y o daughter, was booked without me!!! 

I can’t even get my AA app to work to see any boarding passes for both of us. You can see by the screenshot I have attached. Her name is listed with a ticket reference but I do not have one. To make the situation worse, I’ve been on hold for a total of six hours- six hours. 

The first time I called was at the airport (Charlotte). I chose the “call me back option” and the message stated four + hours (this was at 6pm tonight). I never received a call. When I called again at 1 am the system message asked if I wanted to have someone call me back again. So, I’ve been on hold for over an hour rather than SLEEPING because I’m afraid we will be stranded here tomorrow and I’ll miss a different job interview that is scheduled at 10am in Jackson MS. So.... I have had to pay for three Uber trips to and from the Phoenix airport, flight differences for both me and my child (only to have them cancelled), and now a hotel in the layover city. 

The original point of my contact was this- the carrier was the right size but a hard carrier. If it was the wrong carrier then the American Airlines agent in Jackson MS should have STOPPED me then BEFORE we flew to Phoenix Arizona on the 27th of May. She didn’t. She let us board that plane. When I got on the plane the carrier did not fit under the seat because it was a hard carrier not a collapsible type. So, the stewardess allowed me to put the carrier on the seat next to us. I was NOT TOLD the carrier was the wrong type (and I might add i also paid the pet fee so you know I’m telling the truth) otherwise, I would have purchased a soft carrier BEFORE my flight to Jackson Ms (from Phoenix). 

My 10 y o daughter and I get to the Phoenix Airport at 5:30am and then, at that time I’m told by Ms. Terri at the Phoenix airport that my pet carrier is not the right size. - 2 1/2 hours before my flight leaves. That doesn’t give me enough time to buy a new before the flight because it’s 5:30 am- nothing is open.

And, let’s also talk about how horrible this trip has been. I spend money on a new pet carrier, Uber fees, price differentials in tickets for two people, another pet fee, only to be stranded in the layover City, now having to pay over 200 for a hotel. I can’t even get an American Airline representative on the phone to see if we will be able to get a flight from Charlotte to Jackson tomorrow (wonder if I have to pay for the pet flight again?). 

American offered me a few mileage points- YOU THINK A FEW MILEAGE POINTS MADE UP FOR IT??",True,1,Horrible app horrible airline,2021-06-19 03:57:25
3370,AAL Not Happy,"Even though we were in DFW for 3 hours in between flights The 2 pieces of luggage didn’t make it to Reno.  That is sad.  Other passengers in first class did not receive their luggage either.  

Also as an American stockholder I was most impressed with our flights and the attention to details in service that we received on the flights from Reno to Dallas,  Dallas to Cancun,  Cancun to Dallas and  Dallas to Reno. 

However as we came in to Dallas we were going to visit the admirals club at Gate 23.  As we approached the receptionist we were told we couldn’t enter because only a certain flier had access to the club.  The receptionist told me that my American Airlines credit card I was only paying $90 a year as opposed to $450.  Further, we don’t have  the flight status.  Really!!!   I’m retired now so my travels have changed. My question - is this how American welcomes credit cardholders and values its current, past, and future customers?   The receptionist has little, to no interest in speaking with us.  Are you kidding me!   

I have had an American Airlines credit card for probably close to 40 years. And to receive this cavalier attitude from your staff  is extremely insulting as a stockholder, customer, and a cardholder.   it demonstrates a changing culture at American and should be recognized so investors such as me understanding the changes occurring at American.  

As a stockholder this type of attitude is completely unacceptable. Is this an one off or standard operating policy with American Airlines.     Very disappointing.

With the stock nears  its lows, is this the type of service and attitude that representatives broadly American Airlines’ culture.  As one can tell I’m not a happy camper and extremely irritated that the company that I support.  This treatment should be delivered as feedback as my experience in Dallas at Gate A 23 about 2:30.

3374,whsjxindn,"My paid luggage didn’t make it back with me.

Last minute, I threw my house keys in there.  My luggage didn’t make it back with me. When I went to customer service, they were very casual about it and started a claim. When I shared with the person that was “helping me” that my keys were in there, with full attitude she told me that they advise against that, especially because it was a short time between the connecting flights. When I asked her why they don’t warn customers with this information since she shares it as a matter of fact, she kept saying that it was a legal connecting amount of time and the representative next to her jumps in and they both start speaking over me that they go out of their way to remind everyone to take their keys and medication, etc out of the bag. They wouldn’t even give me a chance to tell them, this was a paid luggage that I checked in at the kiosk!!  I had to stop talking until they were finished telling me off, then once I said that, the second person stopped and just walked away.

I asked the first person if American airline helps with anything especially since I don’t know anyone in this area and it’s almost 11pm. She casually struggling her shoulder said not and kept saying over and over again that I should’ve cared to not put my keys in my luggage.  She gives me the claims form and tells me it’s not my responsibility to call in the morning to ask them to send my luggage with the earliest flights, instead of a direct flight because then it wouldn’t get here until tomorrow night at 11pm. I told her that I couldn’t believe that American airline doesn’t have a better system that to out the customer in charge of coordinating getting to the luck to the destination with the earliest option possible!!

At the end she sarcastically asks me if there is anything she can do for me. It was a slap in the face!  And at that point I couldn’t help but to get sarcastic back and tell her that there are many things that she can do but she chooses not to. She needed to have the last word and kept making sarcastic remarks and I just had to walk away at that point.

The COMPLETE lack of acknowledgement of things going wrong, the casual comment that this can happen with short connections (and it’s fine that there is no warning to the customer at the time of purchase), the teaming up on me to tell me that they warn everyone to take keys and medications out because they were assuming it was a carry-on I had checked in (didn’t even know that it was a paid luggage I had checked in, nor did they care once they let me speak), the REPEATED remakes that I shouldn’t known better than to put my keys in there, the expectations of me to be the one to have to wait until the morning to call and request and plead to get my luggage on their earliest planes, otherwise their automatic default is to get it to me tomorrow night at 11pm and they have no means of notating or taking accountability to be the ones that will call to get it to me the earliest possible, the sarcastic remakes at the end.....  this is what American Airlines’ standards are for customer service?!",False,1,Luggage didn’t make it back with me.,2020-01-16 04:07:42

- couldn’t allow me to use the credit to upgrade to first class

- gave me no support in how to use the credit or how to apply for the refund.

So this must be a great “money maker” for American. i understand now why you’ve had to cancel so many flights over the past few months. Maybe, hopefully, the public is realizing what horrible customer service you offer and the rudeness of your staff.
Not allowing a person to “open their wallet” and use the credit towards an applicable purchase is nothing but a SCAM.
I hope more and more people figure out your disgusting service and eventually you AA will have no customers.

However a notice was up saying boarding closed. Just 5 minutes more and we could have boarded or they could have let us off first. He was transported to the flight via wheelchair. We had waited much longer than that in Dayton. We then had to go by all the way to customer service.  Continue to bear in mind my companion had received a brain procedure in less than a week prior. We were then rescheduled for flight 5212 departing @ 10:15. That flight was again delayed. We spent approximately 8 hours in the airport.

3571,MaxAgHammer,"Well, it’s that time again, folks! Apple has fouled up something on their iTunes App Store servers, and so those of us who are still using iTunes 12.6.5 for Enterprise iOS device support and management are unable to (1) download new purchases from the store, and (2) update existing apps. When you clock the “download” button in the App Store, you see a message “Downloading …” but nothing happens and no error message appears. Similarly, if you click the “update” button on an app update, or the “Update All Apps” button, you will see the same “Downloading …” messages, but nothing will actually download and you’ll see no error message to explain why. This happens for every single app in the app store and every single update shown in the iTMS app updates interface.

Maybe the Big Brains at Apple have chosen this particular moment to finally, silently cut off all iOS app download/update methods except those done via the iDevice’s individual App Store interfaces, making it impossible for IT managers to control app purchase/update rollouts across all of their devices in anything other than an anarchic, catch-as-catch-can fashion. Or maybe they’ve just bungled their backend app update servers, like they seem to do with increasing frequency throughout these last few years of continuing decay and cr*pification of Apple’s feeble Web Services offerings. As usual, Apple support aren’t listening to end-users who submit error reports for this issue, so the only recourse for us is to pass the buck by giving one-star reviews to every app update that’s affected, in the hopes that developers with money on the line and access to actual iTunes Technical Support (as opposed to the teenage babysitters assigned to deal with lowly end-users) can get the problem fixed sometime before the next ice age arrives.

3572,TheCrut,"This app generally works well. The navigation can get confusing sometimes, even for someone who travels multiple times per week. 

My only major gripe is that the app doesn’t show anywhere when the flight boards until maybe a couple hours before the flight. I know that they typically board 30 minutes before departure, but it doesn’t say anywhere!

The android version shows it on the boarding pass. The paper boarding pass shows boarding time. Why not the iPhone app? This seems like a major oversight.",False,4,Doesn’t show boarding time?!,2020-03-01 15:56:21

I wonder if a developer ever tried to book a flight using it, and had to go to another app or source on their phone to get details, such  as checking their calendar, looking up a phone number, DOB, email address, etc. I assume not, otherwise they wouldn’t have released this product. Every time you suspend it to look at another place to pull information, when you come back IT STARTS YOU ALL OVER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEARCH FUNCTION!!! That is UNACCEPTABLE! Then, when you get back to seat selection, the seats you just selected are now blocked, presumably because you previously selected them. You can’t select them again. Not even remotely OK! So, you can’t copy and paste anything because it makes you start over each time. 
Also, the phone number doesn’t allow you to copy and paste from the phone book, because it doesn’t accept the parens or dashes. Also does not accept the 5+4 zip code format.

There is no way to provide FEEDBACK, or to CHAT to ask questions.

AA puts security limiting restrictions on passwords (no more than 16 chars) but doesn’t stop you from making a password that violates the limitation. The app does not allow long passwords but pasting into the website does. 

1 Star, bad security (linger passwords are more secure!) and poor implementation of their bad security.",False,1,Can’t log in (and yes I’m using the right credentials),2019-06-18 16:37:22

3627,Lostconfidence,"My last reservation to Italy was so bad. The flight was to leave at 10:45am and during the middle of the night I got a notice that my flight was leaving at 5:45am through Miami instead of Philadelphia. If I had not been up, I would have missed my first flight. Luckily my ride was accommodating. Then I got charged for two check-ons instead of the one I checked. On May 8 I was charged $60 on TK#:  0010289570523 and $59 on the same day $59 on TK#:  0010647761231. I was to meet my two cousins in Philadelphia. My cousin that flew from Wrightsville Beach NEVER received her luggage. We were gone from May 8-21!!!  We were airbnbing from Almalfi Coast to Florence to Venice.

However I am absolutely positive I put in my 10 digit phone number numerous times. I even added a “1” to see if that would take, and a “+1”, to see if that would take - all of which denied me to continue to create an account on the mobile application, displaying the same online 10 digit phone number error every time I tapped “Submit”.

From a customer point of view, it looks like they have an app only because their competitors have one.  In order for it to function, they require a lot of information, but some of that info is from auto populated fields that don’t work.  You cannot even send a message telling them there is a problem, because you cannot enter info into a required field.  Granted it keeps customer suggestions or complaints at a minimum.
